# GeoFire â€” Realtime location queries with Firebase

GeoFire is a JavaScript library that allows you to store and query a set
of keys based on their geographic location. GeoFire uses Firebase for data
storage, allowing query results to be updated in realtime as they change.

## Downloading

In order to use GeoFire in your project, you need to include the following files in your HTML file:

```html
<!-- RSVP -->
<script src="rsvp.min.js"></script>

<!-- Firebase -->
<script src="firebase.min.js"></script>

<!-- GeoFire -->
<script src="GeoFire.min.js"></script>
```

You can find each of these files in the `/dest/` directory of this GitHub repository. For debugging purposes, there is also a non-minified `GeoFire.js` file in the `/dest/` directory.

You can also download all of these files via Bower [__Note__: GeoFire is currently not available via bower]:

```bash
$ bower install rsvp firebase [geofire]
```

By the time GeoFire version 2.0 is officially released, it will be available via both npm and Bower.

## API Reference

### GeoFire

A `GeoFire` instance is used to read and write geolocation data to your Firebase. You can also use to it create `GeoQuery` objects.

#### new GeoFire(firebaseRef)

Returns a new `GeoFire` instance. The data for this `GeoFire` will be written to the `/indices/` and `/locations/` nodes at `firebaseRef`. Note that this `firebaseRef` can point to anywhere in your Firebase.

```JavaScript
// Create a Firebase reference where GeoFire will store its information
var dataRef = new Firebase("https://my-firebase.firebaseio-demo.com/");

// Create a GeoFire index
var geoFire = new GeoFire(dataRef);
```

#### GeoFire.set(key, location)

Returns an empty promise fulfilled when the provided `key` - `location` pair has been added to Firebase.

`location` must have the form [latitude, longitude].

`key` must be a string or number.

```JavaScript
geoFire.set("some-unique-key", [37.785326, -122.405696]).then(function() {
  alert("Location has been added to GeoFire");
}, function(error) {
  // Handle error case
});
```

#### GeoFire.get(key)

Returns a promise fulfilled with the `location` corresponding to the provided `key`. If the `key` does not exist, the returned promise is fulfilled with `null`.

The returned location will have the form [latitude, longitude].

`key` must be a string or number.

```JavaScript
geoFire.get("some-unique-key").then(function(location) {
  alert("Provided key has a location of " + location);
}. function(error) {
  // Handle error case
});
```

#### GeoFire.remove(key)

Returns an empty promise fulfilled when the provided `key` has been removed from Firebase. If the the provided `key` is not in this `GeoFire`, the promise will successfully resolve immediately.

This is equivalent to calling `set(key, null)`.

`key` must be a string or number.

```JavaScript
geoFire.remove("some-unique-key").then(function() {
  alert("Location has been removed from GeoFire");
}, function(error) {
  // Handle error case
});
```

#### GeoFire.query(queryCriteria)

Returns a new `GeoQuery` instance with the provide `queryCriteria`.

The `queryCriteria` must be a dictionary containing the following keys:

* `center` - the center of this query with the form [latitude, longitude]
* `radius` - the radius, in kilometers, of this query

```JavaScript
var geoQuery = geoFire.query({
  center: [10.38, 2.41],
  radius: 10.5
});
```

### GeoQuery

A standing query that tracks a set of keys matching a criteria. A new `GeoQuery` is returned every time you call `GeoFire.query()`.

#### GeoQuery.getCenter()

Returns the `location` which marks the center of this query.

The returned `location` will have the form [latitude, longitude].

```JavaScript
var geoQuery = geoFire.query({
  center: [10.38, 2.41],
  radius: 10.5
});

var center = geoQuery.getCenter();  // center === [10.38, 2.41]
```

#### GeoQuery.getRadius()

Returns the `radius` of this query, in kilometers.

```JavaScript
var geoQuery = geoFire.query({
  center: [10.38, 2.41],
  radius: 10.5
});

var radius = geoQuery.getRadius();  // radius === 10.5
```

#### GeoQuery.updateQueryCriteria(newQueryCriteria)

Updates the query criteria for this query.

`newQueryCriteria` must be a dictionary containing `center`, `radius`, or both.

```JavaScript
geoQuery.updateQueryCriteria({
  center: [-50.83, 100.19],
  radius: 5
});
```

#### GeoQuery.getResults()

Returns a promise fulfilled with a list of dictionaries containing the `key` - `location` pairs which are currently within this query.

The returned list will have the following form:

```JavaScript
[
  { key: "key1", location: [latitude1, longitude1] },
  ...
  { key: "keyN", location: [latitudeN, longitudeN] }
]
```

If there are no keys currently within this query, an empty list will be returned.

```JavaScript
geoQuery.getResults().then(function(results) {
  results.forEach(function(result) {
    console.log(result.key + " currently in query at " + result.location);
  });
}, function(error) {
  // Handle error case
});
```

#### GeoQuery.on(eventType, callback)

Attaches a `callback` to this query for a given `eventType`. The `callback` will be passed two parameters, the location's key and the location's [latitude, longitude] pair.

Valid `eventType` values are `key_entered`, `key_left`, and `key_moved`.

`key_entered` is fired when a key enters this query. This can happen when a key moves from a location outside of this query to one inside of it or when a key is written to `GeoFire` for the first time and it falls within this query.

`key_left` is fired when a key moves from a location inside of this query to one outside of it.

`key_moved` is fired when a key which is already in this query moves to another (or the same) location inside of it.

Returns a `GeoCallbackRegistration` which can be used to cancel the `callback`. You can add as many callbacks as you would like by repeatedly calling `on()`. Each one will get called when its corresponding `eventType` fires. Each `callback` must be cancelled individually.

```JavaScript
var onKeyEnteredRegistration = geoQuery.on("key_entered", function(key, location) {
  console.log(key + " entered query at " + location);
});

var onKeyMovedRegistration = geoQuery.on("key_moved", function(key, location) {
  console.log(key + " moved within query to " + location);
});

var onKeyLeftRegistration = geoQuery.on("key_left", function(key, location) {
  console.log(key + " left query to " + location);
});
```

#### GeoQuery.cancel()

Terminates this query so that it no longer sends location updates. All callbacks attached to this query via `on()` will be cancelled. This query can no longer be used in the future.

```JavaScript
var geoQuery = geoFire.query({
  center: [10.38, 2.41],
  radius: 10.5
});

geoQuery.cancel();
```

### GeoCallbackRegistration

An event registration which is used to cancel a `GeoQuery.on()` callback when it is no longer needed. A new `GeoCallbackRegistration` is returned every time you call `GeoQuery.on()`.

#### GeoCallbackRegistration.cancel()

Cancels this `GeoCallbackRegistration` so that it no longer fires its callback.

```JavaScript
// This example stops listening for new keys entering the query once the
// first key leaves the query

var onKeyEnteredRegistration = geoQuery.on("key_entered", function(key, location) {
  console.log(key + " entered query at " + location);
});

var onKeyLeftRegistration = geoQuery.on("key_left", function(key, location) {
  console.log(key + " left query to " + location);
  onKeyEnteredRegistration.cancel();
});
```
## Example Usage

```JavaScript
// Create a Firebase reference where GeoFire will store its information
var dataRef = new Firebase("https://my-firebase.firebaseio-demo.com/");

// Create a GeoFire index
var geoFire = new GeoFire(dataRef);

// Add a key to GeoFire
geoFire.set("some-unique-key", [37.785326, -122.405696]).then(function() {
  // Do something after the location has been written to GeoFire
});

// Create a location query for a circle with a 10.5 km radius
var geoQuery = geoFire.query({
  center: [10.38, 2.41],
  radius: 10.5
});

// Get the keys currently in the query
geoQuery.getResults().then(function(results) {
  results.forEach(function(result) {
    console.log(result.key + " currently in query at " + result.location);
  });
});

// Log the results (both initial items and new items that enter into the query)
var onKeyEnteredRegistration = geoQuery.on("key_entered", function(key, location) {
  console.log(key + " entered query at " + location);
});

// Terminate the query (we will no longer receive location updates from the server for this query)
geoQuery.cancel();
```

## Promises

As can be seen in the example usage above, GeoFire uses promises when writing and retrieving data. Promises represent the result of a potentially long-running operation. Promises do not block execution and act as an object which contains the promised result. Whenever the result has been computed, the promise will call its `then()` method and pass it the result.

GeoFire uses the lightweight [RSVP.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js/) library to provide an implementation of JavaScript promises. If you are unfamiliar with promises, please refer to the [RSVP.js documentation](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js/) for all of the details. Here is a quick example of the use of a promise:

```JavaScript
var promise = new RSVP.Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  var data = getData();
  resolve(data);
});

promise.then(function(result) {
  // Will be called after the promise resolves
  // result will contain the same values as the data passed into resolve() above
}, function(error) {
  // Otherwise, will be called if the promise rejects
})
```

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to GeoFire, you'll need to run the following
commands to get your environment set up.

```bash
$ npm install -g gulp   # install global gulp js task runner if not already present
$ git clone https://github.com/firebase/GeoFire.git
$ npm install    # install local npm build /test dependencies
$ bower install  # install local JavaScript dependencies
$ gulp serve     # watch for file changes and start server
```

`gulp serve` will watch for changes in the `/src/` directory and lint, concatenate, and minify the source files when a change occurs. It also starts a server running GeoFire at `http://localhost:6060`.

During development, you can run the test suite by navigating to `http://localhost:6060/tests/TestRunner.html` or run the tests via the command line using `gulp test`.
