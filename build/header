 * GeoFire is an open-source library that allows you to store and query a set
 * of keys based on their geographic location. At its heart, GeoFire simply
 * stores locations with string keys. Its main benefit, however, is the
 * possibility of retrieving only those keys within a given geographic area -
 * all in realtime.
